# School_District_Analysis

## Overview of School District Analysis
For this project, I was tasked to complete an analysis of 15 high schools within a city school system. The information included math and reading standardized test scores from the system's 39,170 students, as well as budget information for all schools.  The information would then be used to spot any trends and aid in future decision-making processes such as funding and priorities. After the information was tallied and presented, I was contacted regarding concerns of academic integrity for students in ninth grade at one particular high school, and was asked to remove the math and reading scores from this population and present updating findings without this data.
