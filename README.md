# School_District_Analysis

## Overview of School District Analysis
For this project, I was tasked to complete an analysis of 15 high schools within a city school system. The information included math and reading standardized test scores from the system's 39,170 students, as well as budget information for all schools.  The information would then be used to spot any trends and aid in future decision-making processes such as funding and priorities. The following analyses were performed during this project:

 * Ensuring completeness of school and student data
 * Calculating total budget for all schools in system
 * Calculating average reading and math testing scores for all students
 * Determining the number of students who passed:
      + Reading
      + Math
      + Reading and Math
